# Tomoclicker
Tomoclicker the definitive autoclicker!

# Initial set-up
Tomoclicker is built in python 3.10 and utilizes a couple external libraries in order to build the GUI.
In order to be able to run, make sure you have installed tkinter and pyautogui libraries:
  ```pip install tkinter``` and 
  ```pip install pyautogui```
  
Tomoclicker was also built in a windows 10 environment and has not been tested for other operating systems.

When all dependencies have been satisfied, simply double clicking the tomoclicker.py file should boot up the program and GUI, happy clicking :)

In this version, tomoclicker can autoclick (single default speed), save autoclicking coordinates, delete autoclicking coordinates and finally load autoclicking coordinates.
